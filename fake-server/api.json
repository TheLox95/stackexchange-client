Then I printed the user input which also was \"B\", but for some reason python does not execute the if statement below, even though the condition seems to be True. The condition states that userAnswer (which is where the user input is stored) is equal to the variable x the statement \"You got that right should print\" this is however not happening and the statement appears to evaluate as false, because if I put an else statement below it, it evaluates the else statement to true and executes the code under it. I would be really thankful if anyone could help me figure this one out.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I am editing as the question was marked as a possible duplicate, I don't think it is a duplicate as the question that seems similar asks about why is readline() not reading an empty line, where my question was why \"B\" seems to not be equal to \"B\" (the problem was that I didn't know that print() doesn't tell you exactly what the variable is, thanks to a comment and the answer I choose as the most helpful I learned about print(repr()) which basically solved my problem).</p>\n"

As a temporary fix we've done the following in the calling service:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ServicePointManager.ServerCertificateValidationCallback += (a, b, c, d) =&gt; true;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Of course, we'd rather not just blindly say \"yup, looks good\" when validating server certs, so how should we go about resolving this issue? Is there another way to set up the client(s) so that they can properly validate the server cert on the request without needing our own callback? Or do we just need to put acceptable thumbprints in our config and compare against those in the <code>ServicePointManager</code> callback or whatever?</p>\n"

            "body": "<p>Since @earldouglas has already started to propose workarounds,\nI'll also simply dump my findings here, and share my humble\nopinion on how this should be done properly without agonizing pain.</p>\n\n<p>First, I'll show what worked. Even though we want to use a Scala library from Java, I will sketch how to turn it around so that \nwe only use Java from Scala, and never the other way around. My failed attempt to make Java do the heavy lifting is in the appendix. </p>\n\n<p>My scala -version is 2.12.4, my javac -version is 1.8.</p>\n\n<h3>TL;DR</h3>\n\n<p>If instantiating Scala entities in Java code does not work, hide everything behind a Java-interface, and implement this interface in Scala.</p>\n\n<h3>Workaround proposal</h3>\n\n<p>If you are using some mainstream Scala framework, it probably \nhas a completely separate Java API (e.g. Spark, Akka, Play), then\n<em>please use that</em>!</p>\n\n<p>If it is a less known Scala software package without a separate\nJava API, do the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Write down a minimal, clean user-facing API in pure Java</li>\n<li>Provide framework-facing interfaces in Java</li>\n<li>Implement the Java interfaces in Scala</li>\n<li>Provide an entry point to the Java API implementation</li>\n<li>Use the pure-Java API in your Java code</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Why it should work: Scala always tries to adjust to Java.\nJava completely ignores Scala. Therefore, it is <em>much easier</em>\nto call Java code from Scala, and implement Java interfaces in\nScala, than the other way around. Given that Scala has so many\nconcepts that Java hasn't, I don't understand why anyone \nexpects to be able to take a Scala library and use it from\nJava.</p>\n\n<p>So, let's get it done:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 0:</strong> Look at the third-party Scala library</p>\n\n<p>Suppose that this is our third-party Scala library, that\nhas <code>superImportantMethod</code>s and computes <code>superImportantThings</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>/* Suppose that this is the external Scala library \n * that you cannot change.\n * A = Outer\n * B = Inner\n * \n * + I added at least one member and one\n * method, so that it's not so boring and trivial\n */\n\nclass A {\n  var superImportantMemberOfA: Int = 42\n  class B[T](t: T) {\n    def superImportantMethod: String = t + \"\" + superImportantMemberOfA\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Step 1/2:</strong> Minimal Java API for use in your Java project</p>\n\n<p>We will use these interfaces in our java project, and implement them\nusing Scala directly:</p>\n\n<pre><code>interface A_j {\n  &lt;X&gt; B_j&lt;X&gt; createB(X x);\n}\n\ninterface B_j&lt;X&gt; {\n  String superImportantMethod();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Step 3: Implement the interfaces in Scala</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>/** Implementation of the java api in \n  * Scala\n  */\nclass A_javaApiImpl extends A_j {\n  private val wrappedA: A = new A\n\n  private class B_javaApiImpl[X](val x: X) extends B_j[X] {\n    private val wrappedB: wrappedA.B[X] = new wrappedA.B[X](x)\n    def superImportantMethod: String = wrappedB.superImportantMethod\n  }\n\n  def createB[X](x: X): B_j[X] = new B_javaApiImpl[X](x)\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> provide an entry point to the API</p>\n\n<pre><code>/** Some kind of entry point to the \n  * java API.\n  */\nobject JavaApi {\n  def createA: A_j = new A_javaApiImpl\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Use the java-only API in your Java code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class JavaMain {\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\n\n    // Use the Java API in your Java application\n    // Notice that now all A_j's and B_j's are\n    // pure Java interfaces, so that nothing \n    // should go wrong.\n    A_j a = JavaApi.createA(); // the only call of a Scala-method.\n    B_j&lt;String&gt; b = a.createB(\"foobarbaz\");\n    System.out.println(b.superImportantMethod());\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now nothing should go wrong, because Java (almost) never calls any\nScala methods or constructors, and by defining a clear API you also \nhave a guarantee that you will not run into any problems because\nsome Scala concepts cannot be represented in Java. Indeed, it does \ncompile and run:</p>\n\n<pre><code> [info] Running (fork) JavaMain \n [info] foobarbaz42\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3>(Failed) attempt to instantiate inner Scala classes from Java</h3>\n\n<p>I started with these definitions (slightly abbreviated code from your question):</p>\n\n<p>.scala:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class A {\n  class B[T]\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>.java:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class JavaMain {\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\n    A a = new A();\n    A.B&lt;String&gt; b = a.new B&lt;String&gt;(a);\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Notice that the javac compiler required a parameter of type <code>A</code> for the <code>B</code> constructor,\nwhich already was somewhat suspicious, and not really intuitive.</p>\n\n<p>It compiled, but when I tried to run it, I got the following cryptic error message:</p>\n\n<p>[error] Exception in thread \"main\" java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: A$B.(LA;LA;)V\n[error]         at JavaMain.main(JavaMain.java:4)</p>\n\n<p>I had absolutely no clue what this is supposed to mean, so I decompiled the generated\n\".class\"-files:</p>\n\n<p>Decompiled A.class: </p>\n\n<pre><code>public class A {\n\n    public class B&lt;T&gt; {\n        public /* synthetic */ A A$B$$$outer() {\n            return A.this;\n        }\n\n        public B() {\n            if (A.this == null) {\n                throw null;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Decompiled A$B.class:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class A.B&lt;T&gt; {\n    public /* synthetic */ A A$B$$$outer() {\n        return A.this;\n    }\n\n    public A.B() {\n        if (A.this == null) {\n            throw null;\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Decompiled JavaMain.class:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class JavaMain {\n    public static void main(String[] arrstring) {\n        A a;\n        A a2 = a = new A();\n        a2.getClass();\n        A.B b = new A.B(a2, a);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>While it might be that my Java is a bit <em>rust</em>y \n(in the original, bad sense of the word), the <code>new A.B(a2, a)</code>\npart doesn't even look like valid java to me (and neither to\nthe javac).

I have to unpair from my device and repeat the process for a connection to be established.</p>\n\n<p>How can I setup the HM-10 so that my phone will automatically connect to it whenever it is within range?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n"

However, I want that view to be transparent initially, hence I've set it's alpha to zero:</p>\n\n<p><code>indicatorContainer.setAlpha(0);</code></p>\n\n<p>Now, the animations won't work. It will never become visible. If I comment out that line, the view is initially displayed (which I don't want), but my animations works fine when I invoke them. I though it's something trivial but apparently it's not. What am I doing wrong?</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I've also tried a floating point <code>0f</code> instead of integer <code>0</code> after reading some API changes involving the <code>setAlpha</code> method, thinking that my call may be calling the incorrect overload, but nothing changed.</p>\n"

It was just going to be a simple Platformer game with squares of different sizes and colors for the Player, obstacles and so on. So far what i've found very challenging to do is the movement. I've found a way around most of the other issues but i cannot figure out how to achieve smooth Platformer style walking and jumping. My attempts have led to the player succeeding to move but always stopping to carry out another movement instead of performing both actions at the same time. For example: Right, Stop, Jump, Stop, Right, Stop, Jump. Here is the script i used (without the keys' actions). I am open to suggestions on how to create smooth Platformer style walking and jumping.</p>\n\n<pre><code>document.onkeydown = KeyPressed;\n\n\nfunction KeyPressed(k) {\n\nvar LeftBtn = 37;\n\nvar RightBtn = 39;\n\nvar UpBtn = 38;\n\nvar DownBtn = 40;\n\n if (k.keyCode == LeftBtn) {\n     // Left Arrow Actions\n }\n\n if (k.keyCode == RightBtn) {\n     // Right Arrow Actions\n }\n\n if (k.keyCode == UpBtn) {\n     // Up Arrow Actions\n }\n }\n</code></pre>\n"

Then I printed the user input which also was \"B\", but for some reason python does not execute the if statement below, even though the condition seems to be True. The condition states that userAnswer (which is where the user input is stored) is equal to the variable x the statement \"You got that right should print\" this is however not happening and the statement appears to evaluate as false, because if I put an else statement below it, it evaluates the else statement to true and executes the code under it. I would be really thankful if anyone could help me figure this one out.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I am editing as the question was marked as a possible duplicate, I don't think it is a duplicate as the question that seems similar asks about why is readline() not reading an empty line, where my question was why \"B\" seems to not be equal to \"B\" (the problem was that I didn't know that print() doesn't tell you exactly what the variable is, thanks to a comment and the answer I choose as the most helpful I learned about print(repr()) which basically solved my problem).</p>\n"
